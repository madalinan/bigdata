Assignment # 1 "Getting a taste for Big Data"

Searching in a set of Apache logs, compute how much bandwidth an IP has used.

Apache logs are text files, compressed using gzip, sitting in a directory on disk. Files have the extension '.log.gz'. The text file format is documented in the attached picture.

Write a program that accepts an IP address (a string) and prints out a number - the bandwidth consumed, in bytes.

You can use any programming language (Java, Scala, PHP, Bash, C++, ...), and/or any technology (Hadoop MapReduce, MySQL, Spark, MongoDB, etc)

Think about these concerns:
- Speed of processing
- Degree of parallelism
- Least IO (try to gunzip on the fly!)
- How short the code is
- How much latency your program has; i.e. how much time passes from the arrival of a new log file until the statistics are up to date.

An example set of log files is attached.
